Instructions

Be sure not to mess with phpmyadmin login settings due to the fact there is a file called "Config.php" that would have to be constantly updated if you set any passwords. Remember we are developing on local systems so security isn't much of a problem.

When you pull, please update the database since there maybe new data to share among developers
1. log into phpmyadmin when XAMPP or MAMP has started. (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Delete the old database
3. Import the new database
4. (opt) if you have modified the database, please export it as .sql and place it in the home folder for others to repeat steps 1-3

Keep in mind that the backend deals with routes so if there is a new page you want to create, please contact Ben with details so that it can be incorporated
